          <p class="px-5 lead">Appreciation of language and literature has followed me since the earliest days. Since my
            childhood, I've used every single book as an opportunity to read and improve my imagination,
            which later on resulted in writing my own poems and stories.
            I have written my first poem at the age of seven, and since then, my writing talent has
            empowered passion for words and marked my life path.</p>
          <p class="px-5 lead about-me-add">To be completely honest with you, my entire life is somehow related to
            writing, and my
            whole personality is permeated with it.
            Expression of ideas and emotions through words - that's what I've been born for...</p>

                    <p class="lead">Anniversaries always need to be celebrated in special ways. Let's think for a few
                      moments why people even celebrate such days. Can anniversary be like any other, ordinary day? No,
                      it
                      cannot. It is psychologically proven that people who celebrate their anniversaries have happier
                      and
                      longer-lasting relationships.</p>

                    <p class="lead">What do you do on that day? You remind your partner and yourself how happy you are
                      to
                      be together. You laugh about all those amazing moments you have spent together, you talk about
                      your
                      past, your future... If you are thinking about making an anniversary even more special and
                      surprise
                      your partner, know that you are in a perfect place to achieve that easily!</p>

                    <p class="h5">A perfect choice to make your anniversary sweet - Italian sweets and chocolates</p>

                    <p class="lead">Countless couples all around the globe have already made their partners happy with
                      my
                      unique and handmade chocolate confectionery. The best would be to start with thinking about Gift
                      Wrapped Soft Nougat which comes in a pack of 3 or Miniature Five Gift Wrapped flavors. Prosecco
                      Willow Hamper is also an amazing choice if you want to create a special night you two will
                      remember
                      for your whole lives.</p>

                    <p class="lead">My chocolate confectionery collections offer you a wide range of flavours which can
                      satisfy everyone's preferences. If you want to surprise him, the best would be to think of
                      flavours
                      he likes. I can suggest you try with chocolate eggs like William Morris Nutty Forest, Arabian
                      Nights, Fruit Garden, Coconut Folies or Decadent Spiced. Nutty Mini Eggs and Fondant Lovelies also
                      come in amazing shapes and even better tastes. For her, Italian Bomboniere will be just perfect.
                      You
                      can get her a chocolate gift box like Almond Soft Nougat, Hazelnut and Cocoa Soft Nougat or even
                      Pistachio Soft Nougat. Which of these Italian sweets and chocolates suits your partner the best?

                    <p class="h5">Why is Lavolio luxury confectionery so adored all around the globe?</p>

                    <p class="lead">Before I have realized how making unique and hand-made Italian sweets and chocolates
                      is my life call, I have heard numerous people talking about how Venchi is the best brand of
                      Italian
                      chocolate confectionery. I may agree that Venchi is amazing, yet, I have also realized how all
                      confectionery brands are actually missing something. Although their products are luxurious and
                      very
                      tasty, I wanted to make something different and even more special. </p>

                    <p class="lead">People always connect chocolates with gifts, and that is exactly why I have focused
                      on
                      handmade products from artisan chocolate. Later on, countless people claimed how I am now the best
                      brand of Italian sweets and chocolates. All my chocololate confectionery is award-winning. </p>

                    <p class="lead">Make your anniversary remarkable with any chocolate gift box from my collections.
                      Lavolio, Nutty Forest and William Morris will make your anniversary unforgettable.</p>
